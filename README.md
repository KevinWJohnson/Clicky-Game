# Clicky-Game

* The user clicks on an image to start the game
* The user gets a point for every image that is clicked that has not been previously clicked since the start of the game
* When a user clicks on an image that was previously clicked, the game is over, and the user's score is set to 0
* Each time an image is clicked the images are shuffled in random order
* The application keeps track of the user's score and the top score of the user since the browser was opened or reset
